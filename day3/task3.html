      <div class="left"> Oh? Bob! </div>
      <div class="right">Hey Sam! Good to see you! </div>
      <div class="left">How’s it going? </div>
      <div class="right">Yeah, good. Working a lot. And you? </div>
      <div class="left">I went back to school. </div>
      <div class="right">Good for you! </div>
      <div class="left"> Mike? </div>
      <div class="right">Jim? </div>
      <div class="left">What have you been up to? </div>
      <div class="right"> Working a lot. </div>
      <div class="date">11 Aug 2024</div>
      <div class="left">That sounds hard. </div>
      <div class="right">How’s the family? </div>
      <div class="left">Everyone is good. Thanks! </div>
      <div class="right">Oh hey, I didn’t see you there. Did you already get a table? </div>
      <div class="left"> Yeah, right over here. </div>
      <div class="right">I’m glad we had time to meet up. </div>
      <div class="left">Me too. So, what’s going on? </div>
      <div class="right"> Oh, not much. You? </div>
      <div class="date">13 Aug 2024</div>
      <div class="left">Not much. Hey, how did your interview go? Wasn’t that today? </div>
      <div class="right">Oh, yeah. I think it went well. I don’t know if I got the job yet, but they said they would call in a few days. </div>
      <div class="left">Well, I’m sure you did great. Good luck. </div>
      <div class="right"> Thanks. I’m just happy that it’s over. I was really nervous about it. </div>
      <div class="left"> I can understand that. I get nervous before interviews, too. </div>
      <div class="right"> Well, thanks for being supportive. I appreciate it.</div>
      <div class="left">Sure, no problem. </div>
      <div class="right"> Hey, so I’m having a party at my place next weekend. Do you want to come? </div>
      <div class="left">Sure! That sounds like fun. Who else is coming? </div>
      <div class="right"> Let’s see. I think it’s going to be Jerome, Talia, Anna, Juan, Celeste, Michelle and possibly Jamie. It’s not really going to be a party, more like a s </div>
      <div class="left">What time should I be there?<img src="https://zimsportlive.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/KL-Rahul.jpg" alt=""> </div>
      <div class="right"> Oh, anytime between 6 and 7 would be fine. </div>
      <div class="left"> Can I bring anything? </div>
      <div class="date">15 Aug 2024</div>
      <div class="right"> Oh, don’t worry about it. I have everything covered. </div>
      <div class="left"> Can I at least bring a bottle of wine? </div>
      <div class="right">Well, I’m not going to say no to wine. I’m sure that would be appreciated. </div>
      <div class="left"> I’ll do that, then. Thanks for inviting me. </div>
      <div class="right"> Hi, Gemma. You look terrible! </div>
      <div class="left"> Hey, Makayla. Mmm, I haven’t slept. </div>
      <div class="right"> Are you OK? What’s the matter? <img src="https://www.sportzcraazy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ms-dhoni.jpeg" alt="">  </div>
      <div class="left">Well, you know that photo I sent to Clare on Friday night? </div>
      <div class="right">Yeah?       </div>
      <div class="left">Well, she sent it to Justin. </div>
      <div class="right">Oh no! How could she do that? It obviously was only for her. </div>
      <div class="left"> I know! I thought she’d find it funny.</div>
      <div class="right"> Well, it was quite funny. But you didn’t expect her to send it to anyone. </div>
      <div class="left">No, of course not! Especially not Justin! Oh, it’s so embarrassing!</div>
      <div class="right"> Ah well, don’t worry. I know how you feel, though. </div>
      <div class="left"> And what if he puts it on Facebook or something? What if my mum sees it? </div>
      <div class="right">: No no, don’t worry. He won’t. It’s not that interesting for him or anyone else, to be honest. </div>
      <div class="left">But what if he does? </div>
      <div class="right">He won’t. But maybe ask Clare to speak to Justin… Get him to delete the photo? </div>
      <div class="left">Yeah, maybe. But that might just make him even more interested.</div>
      <div class="right"> Yeah, true. </div>
